# Email app

## Purpose

Prototype a first-version student enquiry workflow for a department using Microsoft Forms, Power Automate, Excel lookup data, and email.

This project is intentionally lightweight:

- Microsoft Form for intake
- Power Automate for enrichment and notifications
- Excel Online as the first lookup source
- staff handling through a normal inbox first, then a shared mailbox
- no full case-management platform in version 1

## Recommended version 1

- Use one department form with a small number of checkpoint fields.
- Generate the enquiry reference from the Forms response ID so version 1 does not need a separate counter store.
- Use an Excel table keyed on normalized university email.
- Send one structured staff email and one student acknowledgement email for every submission.
- Keep routing advisory only through subject tags and a suggested owner field.

## What to open first

1. `workflow.html`
2. `START_HERE.html`
3. `START_HERE.pdf`
4. `simple_setup_steps.md`

## Next 3 concrete tasks

1. Confirm the pilot mailbox, eventual shared mailbox, and form owner account.
2. Use the first-build guide to create the form by Quick Import and create the lookup workbook.
3. Build and test the flow with matched and unmatched records before switching to the shared mailbox.

## Packaging note

This folder is intended to work as a standalone handover pack. If you need to send it to someone else, zip the whole `other/email_app` folder so the relative links keep working.
